# Atomistic Energy Simulation: Problem Statement

Write a C program to simulate a system of `N` atoms with random positions, velocities, and masses. Calculate the total kinetic and gravitational potential energies of the system, converting results to electron volts (eV). Output the total kinetic energy, total potential energy, and the sum of both.
